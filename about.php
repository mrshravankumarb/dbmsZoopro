      <h5 class="w3-center">RajaRajeshwari Zoo, keepin' it wild since 1937</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">RR Zoo (also known as The RR Zoological Park and Gardens) is the largest and oldest zoological garden in Bangalore, and the only sub-tropical zoo in the Asian continental.The unique climate in Karnataka allows us to keep a wide variety of animals from Asia, Australia and Africa, representing a broad mix of species that is unlike any other zoo in the country.
Our animals are grouped according to their geographic territories, with species that live together peacefully in the wild placed in exhibits together here at the zoo. Our trees, foliage and even our soil are matched as closely as possible to the native habitats of our animals.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The history of the zoo can be traced back to 1937, with what was then known as the Bangalore Zoo in Mysuru State. At that time, the zoo occupied 48 acres of the park and its first animals included some two Russian black bears, an ocelot, and African green monkey, a rhesus monkey, and a goat that had been stranded when a circus went out of business in Bangalore.

RR Zoo today occupies almost 750 acres, and is home to more than 3,000 animals representing over 500 different species. Of this population, more than 40 species are classified as endangered. The zoo also houses more than 1,000 species of trees, palms and other plants, and over 100 special exhibits showcasing a broad number of species and scientific topics.

We are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) which means we have passed a rigorous application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts.

RR Zoo is proud to be an active leader in many global wildlife and environmental conservation initiatives, and we are currently involved in over 36 projects taking place on six continents.</p>
